    "### Metadata CSV vs. JSON Lines Data File\n",
    "All of the textual data and metadata is available inside of the JSON Lines files, but we have chosen to offer the metadata CSV for two primary reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The JSON Lines data is a little more complex to parse since it is nested. It cannot be easily represented in a table form in something like Pandas. It is nice to be able to easily view all the metadata in a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "2. The JSON Lines data can be very large. Each file contains all of the metadata *plus* unigram counts, bigram counts, trigram counts, and full-text (when available). Manipulating all that data takes significant computer time and costs. Even a modest dataset (~5000 files) can be over 1 GB in size uncompressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information is available, including the metadata categories, in the FAQ [\"What is the data file format?\"](https://docs.constellate.org/what-format-are-jstor-portico-datasets/).

    "By passing the `constellate` client a dataset ID (here called `dataset_id`), we can automatically download the metadata CSV file or the full JSON Lines dataset created by the [dataset builder](https://constellate.org/builder/). By default, these datasets are randomly sampled to 1500 documents. Experience has shown us that this is the right size for teaching/learning where data loads quickly and still gives interesting results.\n",
