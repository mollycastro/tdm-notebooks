    "\n",
    "These [notebooks](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#jupyter-notebook) describe how to turn images and/or pdf documents into plain text using Tesseract [optical character recognition](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#ocr). The goal of this notebook is to help users design a workflow for a research project.\n",
